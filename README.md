# My-Book-Notes
part of learning (A project)

## Book Notes Website

> Developed a web application to track and display notes, ratings, and reading dates for books, inspired by Derek Siversâ€™ book notes site. <br>
> Integrated the Open Library Covers API to fetch book covers and stored book information in a PostgreSQL database. <br> 
> Utilized Node.js, Express, and Axios for server-side programming, with EJS for templating. <br>
> Implemented CRUD operations to allow users to create, read, update, and delete book entries. <br>
> Designed the front end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. <br>
